### **About Me**

I am a final year **Computer Science and Engineering student** at **Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology (RSET)**, passionate about **artificial intelligence, deep learning, and reinforcement learning**. My journey in tech revolves around building intelligent systems and understanding how **AI can solve real-world problems**, particularly in **facial expression recognition** and **context-aware conversational agents**.

I have hands-on experience with **Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe**, alongside strong skills in **data preprocessing, temporal modeling with LSTMs, and graph-based feature engineering**. My recent projects include developing a **weighted graph-based facial expression recognition system** and a **hybrid context prediction system** that combines **dense-sparse retrieval, knowledge graphs, and reinforcement learning**.

I thrive in **problem-solving, research, and experimentation**, whether it’s optimizing model architectures, building pipelines for video-level analysis, or integrating AI with creative applications. With a **forward-thinking approach and growth mindset**, I am continuously expanding my expertise to create **innovative AI-driven solutions**.
