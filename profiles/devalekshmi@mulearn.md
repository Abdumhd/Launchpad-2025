#### Leadership and Influence:

I've had many opportunities to influence others in a positive way through communities like IEEE and µLearn. Often help peers understand areas like Github, basic coding and web development.  I’ve guided juniors in setting up their GitHub profiles, explained version control workflows, and helped them submit their first pull requests.
#### Networking:

I’m actively involved in community servers like µLearn Discord and GitHub discussions, and I make an effort to stay in touch with like-minded peers. My aim is to connect with beginners and help them get started while also learning from more experienced members.
#### Career Plan:

I plan to strengthen my technical foundation in areas like web development, AI, and LLMs, while participating in local hackathons, events, and open-source initiatives.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala already has a strong foundation in terms of education and talent but we need to create more opportunities for skilled individuals to apply and grown their talents within the state. With more initiatives like µLearn, Startup Missions and forums like IEDC we can take the Kerala tech ecosystem to the next level.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

I'm currently contributing to beginner-level projects by creating and publishing websites using HTML and CSS. I used Git for version control and pushed my project to a public repository. I’ve also submitted pull requests to µLearn-related GitHub tasks, including profile additions and markdown edits. I’m learning Git workflows better every day.
#### History of Community Engagement:

I'm regularly active in the µLearn Discord server, helping others with beginner queries related to Git, GitHub, HTML, and CSS. I’ve also shared my experience with juniors and peers during peer learning sessions.
#### Highly Visible Technical Content:
[How I Built My First Chatbot at a Workshop Blog](https://medium.com/@devalekshmi16/how-i-built-my-first-chatbot-at-a-workshop-ceddcb68e94d)
#### Highly Used Software Tools:

At the moment, I’m still building personal projects and have not yet published a software tool with wide adoption.
#### Competitive Website Profiles:
