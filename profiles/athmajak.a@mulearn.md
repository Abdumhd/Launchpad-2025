### About Me

> I’m a passionate and dedicated third-year Computer Science student in College of Engineering Chengannur.
I'm actively building my skills through consistent practice on coding platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, while also deepening my understanding of HTML and CSS to enhance my web development skills. My goal is to apply my technical knowledge to real-world problems, collaborate with inspiring teams, and grow into a software engineer capable of building impactful products.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- As a Computer Science student and creator of HelpMate—an emergency healthcare platform—I’ve demonstrated leadership by identifying a critical societal need and building a digital solution to address I've had many opportunities to influence others in a positive way through communities like Mulearn.Often help peers to understand areas like github,basic coding and web development.

#### Networking:

- Networking to me,is about building mutual connections based on sharing and learning collaboration.I actively engage with coding communities on platforms like LeetCode, GitHub, and Discord, and participate in student-led developer circles. I plan to engage more deeply with Kerala’s tech communities by joining regional hackathons, startup summits, and developer meetups. By sharing my projects and collaborating with peers, I aim to foster knowledge exchange and mentor early-stage developers, particularly in using tech for social good.

#### Career Plan:

- Short term, I plan to strengthen my technical foundation in areas like web development, Al, and LLMs, while participating in local hackathons, events, and open-source initiatives. Long term, I aim to be part of or even start a tech startup that solves real-world problems-especially in education, accessibility, or automation. I also want to mentor other students in their early journeys so we can raise a generation of confident, community-driven technologists within Kerala.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has immense untapped potential in the tech startup ecosystem, especially with its high literacy and digital awareness. To excel, we need stronger bridges between academia and industry, more product-based innovation, and mentorship networks connecting student founders to seasoned entrepreneurs. Government-backed accelerators and community tech labs in colleges can catalyze this transformation.
#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I'm currently contributing to beginner-level projects by helping with documentation, bug fixes, and readme improvements. I've also submitted pull requests to plearn-related GitHub tasks, including profile additions and markdown edits. While I'm still early in my open-source journey, I'm actively exploring issues labeled "good first issue" and learning Git workflows better every day.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I'm regularly active in the µLearn Discord server, helping others with beginner queries related to Git, GitHub, HTML, and CSS. I've also shared my experience with juniors and peers during peer learning sessions.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- My HelpMate project stands as a visible demonstration of applying theory to real-world problems.While I haven't published any blog posts or videos yet, I'm working on documenting my learning journey and plan to share small technical write-ups on platforms like Hashnode, Dev.to, or Linkedin. This includes topics like "My First GitHub Pull Request" or "Getting Started with HTML/CSS."

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

-At the moment, I'm still building personal projects and have not yet published a software tool with wide adoption. However, I'm experimenting with simple web tools and utilities that I plan to share openly with the community soon.
