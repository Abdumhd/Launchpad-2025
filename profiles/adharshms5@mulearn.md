Leadership and Influence

I’ve led multiple academic and freelance projects, mentoring peers in full stack technologies like React and Node.js. During college capstone projects, I took the lead role in architecture design and team coordination, ensuring timely delivery. I also mentor juniors on GitHub, project planning, and technical interview prep.

Networking

I actively engage with the developer community on platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, and Discord tech groups. I regularly connect with peers through µLearn and local hackathons. My goal is to collaborate with Kerala-based startups and student communities to build and share tools, tutorials, and career guidance.

Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem

Kerala has immense potential with its highly literate youth and growing interest in tech. What it needs is more structured mentorship, exposure to real-world projects, and a strong bridge between academia and startups. Grassroots communities like TinkerHub and µLearn are great—scaling such initiatives can truly unlock Kerala’s tech potential.
