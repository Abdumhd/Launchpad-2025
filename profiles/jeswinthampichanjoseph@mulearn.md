### About Me

> I’m a Computer Science undergraduate with a focused interest in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Networks, and Cybersecurity.
My work revolves around understanding how intelligent systems operate securely and efficiently across networks. I’m currently building my foundation in areas like network protocols, system security, and applied AI — with an emphasis on practical, real-world use cases.
I'm an active member of IEEE, where I contribute to initiatives that promote technical learning, collaboration, and community engagement.
Outside academics, I maintain a structured routine — reading, training, and practicing the violin — with a consistent focus on long-term growth and clarity in execution.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I currently serve as the Secretary of IEEE SB SJCET and have previously worked as the IAS Secretary under IEEE. In these roles, I’ve led the planning and execution of technical workshops, student sessions, and community outreach programs — all focused on making learning more hands-on and accessible.
  I don’t see leadership as just managing events, but as creating spaces where people genuinely grow. I’ve consistently focused on coordination, clarity, and technical relevance in every initiative I’ve been part of — whether it's helping juniors navigate their learning paths or streamlining back-end operations for college-level tech events.
  These efforts reflect my ability to influence through structure, initiative, and follow-through.
#### Networking:

- I’ve been actively involved in communities like IEEE, where I represent our Student Branch (SB) and contribute to organizing events that span the Kerala Section. As a volunteer with the Kerala Police Cyberdome and an active member of NSS, I regularly engage with a wide network of students, professionals, and organizers across colleges and domains.
  These roles have helped me grow as a connector—whether it’s managing events, collaborating with tech enthusiasts, or exchanging ideas with experts during summits and inter-college forums. I prioritize meaningful networking and seek out conversations where I can both learn from others and share what I know, especially in areas like emerging technologies, public service, and community development.

#### Career Plan:

- In the short term, my focus is on building strong foundational skills, contributing to real-world projects, and learning from people who are solving tough problems. I want to work closely with teams and mentors within Kerala’s startup ecosystem to better understand how ideas are taken from concept to impact.
  Over time, my goal is to create something of my own — a startup or initiative that’s shaped by the skills I’ve gathered and the people I’ve met. I want it to be rooted in Kerala, but capable of making a wider impact. Beyond just building a product, I hope to contribute to a culture of collaboration, learning, and ambition within the state’s innovation space.
  By staying grounded, staying connected, and staying curious, I aim to give back to the same ecosystem that gave me the space to grow.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala’s tech startup ecosystem is full of raw potential — what we now need is momentum and continuity. From idea to impact, the journey should be smoother: fewer bureaucratic layers, faster access to prototyping facilities, and mentorship that goes beyond motivational talks.
  To thrive, we must also normalize failure — not just tolerate it. Founders should feel empowered to experiment without stigma. Building a robust peer network, founder-first programs, and active cross-college incubator collaborations can transform ambition into companies.
  If Kerala can foster a culture that rewards initiative, supports iteration, and removes fear of imperfection, it can lead not just in innovation — but in resilience.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I contributed to the open-source project SJCET Events, which helps manage college-level tech events. I worked on core features including RSVP handling and backend logic using Vue.js and Firebase. This experience introduced me to real-world collaborative development, and I aim to grow further in open-source by building tools that serve student and developer communities.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I actively contribute to online technical communities such as LinkedIn, Coursera, and various Discord servers. On Coursera, I frequently share insights and help peers understand course content better. On LinkedIn, I engage in tech discussions and reflections around my learning journey. I also participate in domain-focused Discord communities, especially around AI and cybersecurity, where I exchange ideas, troubleshoot with peers, and stay updated with emerging trends.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- I have written technical blog posts on Medium that aim to bridge the gap between foundational concepts and practical understanding. One article delves into Alan Turing and the Enigma machine, providing a clear and engaging explanation of early cryptography’s significance. Another, titled “The Nexus of Hacking, Virtual Machines, Linux, and Networking,” explores the interconnectedness of core cybersecurity and system-level topics. The blogs are available [here](https://medium.com/@jeswintj16)

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- While I haven’t yet developed standalone software tools, I created a dynamic and logic-based Google Sheets calendar currently used by the IEEE Student Branch at my college. Designed with conditional formatting and automated logic, it streamlines event planning and visibility—proving that even simple platforms can deliver practical, scalable solutions when thoughtfully built.
