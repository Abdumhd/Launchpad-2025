#### Leadership and Influence

As the co‑lead of the MuLearn chapter at my college, I have guided and mentored junior developers by helping them clear technical doubts and supporting them in building real-world projects. I have actively fostered a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, encouraging peers to engage in open-source contributions and community-driven initiatives.

#### Networking

Within the MuLearn community, I connect with fellow developers, share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and expand my network. I aim to grow a tight‑knit developer network that supports continuous learning and innovation in Kerala’s tech ecosystem.

#### Career Plan

**Short Term:** Join a startup to work on diverse backend projects, gain hands‑on experience, and sharpen my development skills.
**Long Term:** Become a seasoned senior backend developer, contributing to high-impact systems and mentoring emerging talent.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem

Kerala has a promising future in the startup ecosystem thanks to its skilled talent pool, supportive infrastructure, and innovative potential. By strengthening collaboration between academia and startups, fostering creativity, and improving access to funding and digital infrastructure, Kerala can accelerate its growth and solidify its position in the tech landscape.
