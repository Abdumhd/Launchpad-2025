##  Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem

Kerala has a growing tech community that is rich in talent but still lacks large-scale startup support, mentorship access, and industry-academic collaboration. With stronger bridges between institutions, emerging founders, and government bodies, Kerala can become the next hub for cybersecurity, AI, and SaaS innovation.

##  History of Community Engagement

I’ve engaged technically in Discord groups focused on ethical hacking, security forums, and have attended several hands-on workshops (like BeEF-XSS, Nessus, and Netdiscover sessions). I also collaborate with peers on GitHub and assist juniors with project-based learning in cybersecurity.
