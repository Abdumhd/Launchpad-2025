### About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai. I enjoy coding and web programming, and I'm currently learning Python and the MERN stack to build full-stack web applications. I'm always curious to explore new technologies and improve my skills through hands-on projects and collaboration.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I take initiative in both academic and tech-related activities, showing strong leadership and teamwork. I contributed to projects like CraftConnect,participated in Hackathons like Smart India Hackathon and YIP by supporting idea development and coordination. As part of the UiPath marketing team at SJCET Palai, I help spread awareness about automation and encourage peer participation, influencing others through collaboration and clear communication.

#### Networking:

- I actively build connections with peers by participating in tech events, academic groups, and student communities. I enjoy collaborating, sharing knowledge, and helping others get involved in new opportunities. I lead by being approachable, encouraging, and consistent—motivating others to step up, learn, and grow within the field.

#### Career Plan:

- In the immediate term, I plan to focus on developing my technical and communication skills by working on real-world projects and learning from the environment around me. I aim to engage with like-minded peers, attend events, and understand how early-stage ideas grow.

In the long term, I hope to use these experiences to contribute meaningfully to the Kerala Startup Ecosystem by supporting local innovations, collaborating on impactful projects, and encouraging a culture of learning, creativity, and entrepreneurship among students.


#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- I believe Kerala can grow a strong tech startup ecosystem by encouraging student innovation, improving skill development, and making resources more accessible. With better mentorship, exposure, and support, more young ideas can turn into real impact.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:
- Created technical blog post on medium.

#### History of Community Engagement:

- I stay engaged in the tech community through peer discussions, Discord servers, and platforms like HackerRank, where I solve coding challenges to improve my skills. I often help classmates debug issues and share what I learn. While I haven’t been active on platforms like Stack Overflow yet, I’m steadily building confidence and plan to participate more in technical forums as I grow.
