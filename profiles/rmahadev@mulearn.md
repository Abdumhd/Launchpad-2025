### About Me

Crafting Your Engaging Introduction
I'm a Computer Science student at Kristu Jyoti College of Management and Technology, and I really enjoy making things happen with technology. I'm always curious and love finding new ways to solve problems. Whether it's making websites easy and fun to use (UI/UX), figuring out smart ways to handle information (algorithms), or teaching computers to think and learn (Artificial Intelligence), I'm excited to learn and create things that truly help people.

I've learned the basics of programming, how to organize data, and how to build software well. But what I enjoy most is jumping in, learning new things by doing them, and finding better ways to make technology work. I like a good challenge and always try to improve my skills. I'm not just interested in writing computer code; I want to use my tech skills and creativity to build things that solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.
I'm eager to join a team where I can use my different skills and grow as an innovator in web design, user experience, and AI.

#### Leadership and Influence:
- While I don't always seek out a formal leadership title, I consistently demonstrate responsive leadership by stepping up and taking initiative when a situation demands it. My focus is on problem-solving and ensuring project success, and I naturally assume leadership roles to guide the team and influence positive outcomes when my specific skills or insights are most needed.
  -  Helping the Group Work Together (Being a Mediator): Sometimes, in group projects, people might disagree or get stuck. I've often jumped in to help everyone understand each other's ideas. I'll make sure everyone gets heard and then help us find a solution that works for the whole team. This keeps us focused and productive instead of getting held back by small arguments.
  - Teaching and Sharing Knowledge (CCA Classes): I absolutely love learning new things, especially about tech, and I get even more excited about teaching what I've learned to others. I actually teach classes for students in our CCA (Co-Curricular Activities). I plan lessons, explain difficult ideas in simple ways, and guide students step-by-step. This shows how I can lead a group, help them learn new skills, and feel more confident.
      
- #### Networking:

    -  build strong networks by genuinely listening and sharing knowledge. My passion for learning and teaching, like in my CCA classes, helps me connect with people easily. I'm always looking to share new resources and ideas.

  - Engaging with the Community
   I plan to be very active in the tech community:

    - Online: I'll use LinkedIn to connect with pros, share my projects on GitHub, and join discussions on developer forums about UI/UX and AI.

    - Events: I'll attend hackathons, coding competitions, and local tech meetups/webinars to learn and meet new people. I'll also use my college alumni network for advice.

- Leading and Influencing My Field
   - I'll lead and influence by:

      - Teaching & Mentoring: I'll keep teaching through CCA classes, create online tutorials, and mentor junior students to help them grow.

      - Project Excellence: My impactful projects like "Give App" and "Imagine AI" will show what's possible and set high standards.

      - Driving Collaboration: I'll use my mediation skills to guide team discussions and make sure we find the best solutions together, pushing for smart and ethical approaches in UI/UX and AI.
  


#### Career Plan:
I'm eager to help Kerala's startup scene grow, using my skills in web design (UI/UX) and Artificial Intelligence. I am committed to contributing to the ecosystem.

- Immediate Steps (Next 6-12 Months)
     - Get Involved Locally: I'll join local tech meetups and workshops (like KSUM or GDG events) and volunteer at hackathons. This helps me understand what startups need and connect with people.

     - Secure Internships: I plan to actively seek and join offline and virtual internships in relevant tech companies to significantly boost my practical skills in full-stack development or UI/UX design.

     - Prepare for GATE Exam: I am also planning on writing the GATE exam to strengthen my foundational knowledge and explore higher education opportunities that could further enhance my contributions to the tech sector.

- Longer-Term Vision (1-3 Years & Beyond)
     - 1.Encourage Teamwork: I'll help organize events that bring designers, AI experts, and business people together to spark new ideas.
     - 2.land a job as a Full Stack Developer or UI/UX Designer while completing my degree

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has a strong foundation for its tech startup ecosystem, built on government support, student innovation, and a focus on inclusion. it should focus on special technologies like AI or climate solutions. It needs to link up businesses, colleges, and startups more closely so they solve real problems together. Bringing in more money from big investors is also key. We also need to help our talented people get even better skills and make sure they want to stay and work here instead of leaving. By using Kerala's unique strengths, like caring about social impact and spreading tech work across the state, we can make our startup scene truly special and strong.
#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Utilizing Collaborative Documentation Tools: My involvement with templates like "communicate-using-markdown" highlights my understanding and use of tools essential for effective technical communication and collaboration within projects and communities.
- design-compass:An opensource online library focused on UI/UX design for digital products, including mobile apps and websites


#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I actively engage in the tech community through GitHub, where I host and share beginner-friendly web projects like portfolio sites and interactive tools. I help peers troubleshoot coding and GitHub Pages issues, especially around HTML/CSS and deployment.

- As part of a school CCA program, I co-lead a year-long web development course for 8th and 9th graders, simplifying concepts and guiding them in building real websites. I also participate in Discord developer communities, offering coding help and sharing resources with other learners.
#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- Iâ€™ve created and shared beginner-friendly technical projects and content to support others learning web development:

  - Mahadev Portfolio Website
        - A personal portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate layout, design, and responsiveness: Mahadev Portfolio

  - Technical Blog
        - I occasionally write blog posts where I share my journey with specific projects, tools, or new experiences in tech.
