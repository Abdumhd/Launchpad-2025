### About Me 👨‍💻

> I’m a passionate Computer Science Engineering student at SJCET Palai with a strong interest in Web Development, Automation, and UI/UX design. I actively explore technologies like React, Node.js, and n8n, and love building useful tools and engaging UI experiences. I've participated in internships, technical fests, and open-source projects. I also enjoy sharing knowledge, collaborating on GitHub, and am part of the MuLearn community where I’ve earned karma points and contributed to several guilds. I’m always ready to learn, lead, and give back to the developer community. 🚀

#### Leadership and Influence:
I’ve taken initiative in designing UI, resolving deployment issues, and communicating within cross-functional teams. In the MuLearn community, I regularly help friends and juniors by guiding them through tasks, GitHub usage, and clearing doubts. I also support students from other colleges through LinkedIn and WhatsApp, where I help with coding, web development, and UI/UX design. I’ve even conducted Google Meet sessions to share my knowledge in UI/UX, helping others understand design tools and workflows. By sharing what I know, I aim to influence others positively and create a supportive space for learning and growth. 💡

#### Networking:
I actively engage with developer communities both online and offline to grow, share knowledge, and collaborate. Platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, and MuLearn have helped me connect with fellow students, mentors, and professionals. I regularly post about my projects, internships, and learning journeys to inspire others and start meaningful conversations. In college, I collaborate with peers through tech clubs like CSEA, UiPath Club, and during internships, where I’ve improved my communication and teamwork skills. In the future, I aim to take on mentoring roles, conduct peer sessions, and contribute to open-source and student-focused initiatives — helping others learn, stay motivated, and build confidently in tech. 🤝

#### 🎯 Career Plan
- Immediate Steps (Next 6–12 Months):
Strengthen foundation in coding, UI/UX, and automation through projects, internships, and MuLearn.
Actively help others through LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and conduct Google Meet sessions on UI/UX.
Prepare for the GATE exam to deepen core CS knowledge.

- Longer-Term Vision (1–3 Years):
Intern at startups to gain hands-on exposure and understand real-world challenges.
Work in impactful roles at startups or MNCs, including those in Kerala.
Mentor student developers, promote open-source collaboration, and support Kerala’s tech ecosystem through innovation and community-led initiatives. 💻🌱

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:
Kerala has a strong foundation for a thriving technology startup ecosystem, thanks to its high literacy rate, growing number of skilled students, and initiatives like KSUM, TinkerHub, and MuLearn. To take it to the next level, we need to strengthen industry-academia collaboration, promote more hands-on, project-based learning in colleges, and encourage students to work on real-world problems from an early stage. Support for early-stage startups, access to mentors, and local internship opportunities will also help students stay in Kerala and contribute to homegrown innovations. By creating a culture of open learning, collaboration, and entrepreneurship, Kerala can become a leading hub for tech innovation in India. 🌍✨

#### 💻 History of Open Source Contributions:
- 🖨️ I contributed to an open-source project during the SJCET Palai Bootcamp Internship (June 2025). Our team developed a web application called Print Shop to manage printing slot bookings for students. I worked on the frontend development, collaborating with teammates and mentors. The project was open-sourced and shared within the college community.
- 📝 I also worked on Notely App, an open-source note-taking application developed during the Pacelab Kochi Internship (June 2025). It was a collaborative offline internship where I contributed to the frontend. The project was published on GitHub so others could explore, use, and contribute to it.

#### History of Community Engagement:
- Member of the **UiPath Club Execom Operations Team**
- Active user on GitHub for coding, upskilling and website deployment.
- Active on LinkedIn where I post and share useful technical contentcand other contents.
- Design Team Member of CSEA SJCET Palai (2024–25) – Collaborated on department design tasks like placement posters, hackathon winner posts, and event creatives under the guidance of the CSEA Design Lead.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- Shared my internship experiences and project work on LinkedIn, receiving good engagement.
- Maintained public GitHub repos with well-structured code and documentation
- Posted UI/UX design mockups and interfaces on **Figma**, **Dribbble**, and **Behance** to showcase visual work related to projects.

#### 🛠️ Highly Used Software Tools:

While I haven't developed large-scale tools that are publicly adopted by a wide user base yet, I have contributed to student-focused tools such as:
[Print Shop](https://github.com/iamkarthik2004/Print-Shop) – A web app developed during an internship to manage print slot bookings for students at SJCET. Used by students during the internship phase.
[Notely App](https://github.com/iamkarthik2004/NotelyApp) – A collaborative note-taking app developed during Pacelab internship, shared among peers for academic use.
I aim to continue building practica
