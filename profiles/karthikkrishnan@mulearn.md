### About Me

> I’m a passionate Computer Science Engineering student at SJCET Palai with a strong interest in web development, automation, and UI/UX design. I actively explore technologies like React, Node.js, and n8n, and love building useful tools and engaging UI experiences. I've participated in internships, technical fests, and open-source projects. I also enjoy sharing knowledge, collaborating on GitHub, and am part of the MuLearn community where I’ve earned karma points and contributed to several guilds. I’m always ready to learn, lead, and give back to the developer community.
