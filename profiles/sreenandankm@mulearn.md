### About Me

I'm a passionate backend developer and final-year Computer Science student at AWH Engineering College. My journey into tech began in 11th grade when I picked up Python out of necessity and ended up discovering a whole new world. Since then, I’ve been building scalable backend systems, contributing to impactful community platforms like MuLearn and Launchpad Kerala, and diving into the world of AI as an intern at Sixtysix Technologies. I love solving real-world problems with code and am now exploring the intersection of backend development and machine learning.

### Leadership and Influence

I've been part of the core backend team for community-focused platforms like MuLearn and Launchpad Kerala, where I collaborated closely with other developers, managed releases, and led parts of the development pipeline. I’ve also taken ownership of full-stack freelance projects, coordinating with clients directly to deliver impactful results. My leadership lies in staying dependable, mentoring juniors when needed, and constantly iterating for improvement.

---

### Networking

Through my involvement in MuLearn, I’ve had the chance to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts across Kerala. I actively engage with communities on Discord and LinkedIn, and I believe in growing together by sharing knowledge, code, and opportunities. Going forward, I plan to continue mentoring juniors, collaborating with peers on open-source projects, and attending local tech meetups and hackathons.

---

### Career Plan

**Immediate**: Strengthen my backend and AI skills, contribute more deeply to community-based products, and publish more open technical content.  
**Long-term**: Launch or join a startup that solves real problems at scale, while actively contributing to Kerala's tech community by organizing workshops, hackathons, and knowledge-sharing sessions.

### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem

Kerala has a vibrant, fast-growing tech ecosystem that's full of talent but often lacks exposure and product-oriented momentum. By fostering a stronger connection between student communities and industry, promoting open-source culture, and encouraging local startups to build global solutions, Kerala can become a powerful tech hub in the next decade.

---

### History of Open Source Contributions

My most notable open-source contributions have been toward **MuLearn** and **Launchpad Kerala**, where I worked on production-level backend systems. I've also published some small utilities and scripts on GitHub. I'm currently working on turning some of my AI explorations into reusable open-source components.

---

### History of Community Engagement

I’ve been consistently active in the MuLearn community, not just as a contributor but as someone who helps others debug, learn Git, and get started with backend dev. I also mentor juniors in my college and help organize peer-learning sessions.

---


### Highly Used Software Tools

While I haven’t created a tool used by a massive user base (yet), components I’ve built have been used by thousands of users on platforms like [MuLearn](https://app.mulearn.org) and [Launchpad Kerala](https://launchpadkerala.org).
