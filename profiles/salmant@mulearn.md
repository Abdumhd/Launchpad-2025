### About Me

I am a passionate Computer Science student in my 3rd year, deeply focused on Flutter app development, full-stack web development, and artificial intelligence. With over a year of consistent project-building and certification-based learning from platforms like freeCodeCamp and Scrimba, I have developed multiple full-stack applications, AI-integrated apps, and participated in open-source communities. My goal is to build practical, scalable, and impactful tech solutions while contributing to the Kerala Startup Ecosystem through innovation, collaboration, and mentorship.

#### Leadership and Influence:

As a consistent contributor to technical communities and a mentor in peer groups, I have guided juniors in understanding Flutter development and web technologies. I led team projects like the Canteen Management System and Multiplayer Games during campus hackathons and Mulearn tasks. I actively help debug and guide peers' code via Discord and GitHub Discussions, building an environment of peer-to-peer learning and problem-solving.

#### Networking:

I network actively through Mulearn, GitHub, and online dev communities. My networking style includes collaborating in group projects, participating in discussions, and giving back by writing solutions or suggestions on Discord, Reddit, and developer forums. I plan to engage with Keralaâ€™s community through local hackathons, open-source drives, and collaborative meetups, both as a participant and mentor.


#### Career Plan:

Immediate Plan:

Complete all 12 planned projects (6 Flutter + 6 Web) by October 2025.

Build 2 AI-integrated applications (1 Web, 1 Flutter) by January 2026.

Start applying for internships and contribute to Kerala startup projects from February 2026.

Long-Term Plan:

Build tools solving local problems in education, transport, and public health.

Launch a startup within the Kerala tech ecosystem by 2027.

Mentor and onboard more developers into open-source and AI development.



#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has massive potential due to its talent pool and growing digital infrastructure. By encouraging early open-source involvement, offering more student-focused innovation labs, and strengthening incubation centers like KSUM, the state can become a national tech leader. We need better documentation, community events, and industry-academia integration to bridge skill gaps and promote real-world problem solving.




#### History of Open Source Contributions:

Contributed to several open-source tasks via Mulearn Web Development Tracks and Flutter challenges.

Fixed bugs and added features to collaborative GitHub repositories (e.g., Tic Tac Toe multiplayer, Flutter UIs, API integrations).

Developed and published reusable components for Firebase-integrated Flutter app
