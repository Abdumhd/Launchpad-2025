#### Leadership and Influence:

- I currently serve as the Campus Lead of the μLearn Community at Perumon Engineering College and was recently selected as the Kollam District Lead. Though my district lead journey has just begun, I’ve already had opportunities to take part in key leadership activities.

- One example is being invited to join the interview panel at another college in our district to help select their new executive committee members. Being trusted with such responsibility reflects how I’m viewed as a leader within the community and district. It also gave me valuable experience in assessing potential, providing feedback, and supporting the growth of student communities beyond my campus.

- As a Campus Lead, I regularly guide students in μLearn activities, helping them navigate technical learning paths and stay consistent through challenges. I actively promote events, encourage participation, and ensure the energy of the community remains high.

- I believe leadership is about being present, setting an example, and supporting others in their growth journey. While I’m still early in my role as a district lead, I’m committed to using every opportunity to influence positively, learn from peers, and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.

#### Networking:

- I have built strong networking skills through my active involvement in μLearn, both as a Campus Lead and now as the Kollam District Lead.

- I stay connected with students from various colleges, regularly interacting in community groups and encouraging participation in learning tracks and events.
  
- I’m approachable and active in communication platforms like Linkedin, where I share tech updates, opportunities, and community initiatives.
  
- I guide juniors and peers by resolving doubts, sharing resources, and motivating them to explore all the fields .
  
#### Career Plan:

- Connect student innovators with mentors and incubation support.

- Share accessible tools and platforms to help students build and test ideas.
  
- Support or start a student-led incubator for early-stage ideas.

- Mentor juniors in product development, pitching, and branding.

- Launch a startup or tech project that solves real-world problems.

- Collaborate with stakeholders to host bootcamps and startup expos.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala’s tech ecosystem is evolving with strong support from initiatives like KSUM, IEDCs, and community platforms such as μLearn. It encourages students to explore innovation through events, mentorship, and learning paths.

- The focus on early engagement is a big strength, but there’s still scope to improve real-world exposure and access to funding. With continued support, Kerala has the potential to become a leading hub for student-driven innovation.
