#### Leadership and Influence:

- As the IEDC Campus Lead, I organized workshops and hackathons that boosted student participation in innovation activities. I also co-led the Shuchithwa Eye project, guiding a team to build a YOLO-based smart city waste detection system, showcasing my ability to influence, motivate, and deliver impactful tech solutions.

#### Networking: 

- I have built strong networking skills through my roles in IEDC, where I connected students, mentors, and industry experts via workshops and hackathons. I actively participate in events like Permute, IEDC Summit, and other tech meetups, expanding my network and exchanging ideas with innovators. I also try to participate in Hackathons, idea pitching and such events to strengthen my network.

#### Career Plan:

-  I want to help student projects move beyond college competitions or ideas by connecting them with mentors and resources. I’m particularly interested in building and supporting projects that solve real local problems and can grow into strong startups from Kerala. We(IEDC, LBSCEK) have currently started an Innovation repository in our college, where students can add their ideas, and we will connect them to a mentor, so that they can start working on the project rather than letting it just be an idea. 

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- I think Kerala can do really well in tech startups if we focus on solving real problems instead of just building projects for competitions. More mentorship and better connections between students, startups, and industry would help ideas grow into proper businesses. Support for deep-tech areas like AI, health tech, solutions could set Kerala apart. And honestly, just having more spaces where people share ideas and build together would make a huge difference.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I have contributed to open-source through my own projects, including Shuchithwa Eye, an AI-based waste detection and smart city monitoring system, and Kasaroam, a cultural and culinary web platform for Kasaragod. I also share smaller ML experiments, YOLO-based detection models, and web development projects on my GitHub.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-   I discuss AI and web development topics in Discord and college forums, contributing to collaborative learning.
