#### Leadership and Influence:

- In cyber security leadership is a strong need because without it nothing could be done in time it should be done in a way which takes into consideration others opinion
- and concerns. In mu opinion true leadership is something that is built on trust and communication and i do belive i am a good leader. Currently i am the CO-Lead if Return0
- community. a cyber community in our college which organizes workshops and CTF challenges. I was also one of the main co-ordinator of INFUCE 2K25 our college tech fest.
- Apart from college roles i also have experience as House leader in various non-academic institutions. 

#### Networking:

- I do belive i have fairly a good amount of networking experience. I am part of InnitCrew community which is one of keralas top Cyber Sec Communities with multiple
- people working in many startups and MNC. Through that community i was able to expand my knowledge and meet many bright minds. For an upcoming Cyber meetup in our college
- i was able to connect to almost 10-15 experienced individuals to ask for their service. Being a part of community has helped me be more updated about the current scenario.
- I am also a cyberdome volunteer which helps me expand my network.

#### Career Plan:

-Well as far as i have observed most of the people in security(Not all) seems to be concentrated on current scenarios and not being prepared for the future.
-We have seen the rise of quantum computing and rarely do we see any companies actually trying to implement Quantum resistant frameworks or atleast try to. Yes its
-difficult to optimise the frameworks but we should try. My plan to to lean towards more R&D side in Cyber security namely PQC and blockchain. I am also interested 
-in securing current systems  R&D is more interesting.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has a rich pool of talented people but currently lacks the proper infrastructure to support them all. But as we all know with more support from our community
- and from the government people can work well on new startups which will actually solve real world problems and is not just another 10 minute grocery delivery app.
- Startups like RoshAI is an example of how capable our youth is.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- As far as of now i havent contributed to open source, my path was less on development and more on security research till recently but since then i have shifted my focus
- to R&D . Traffic-Nexus V1 was one of our contribution to Opensource. We are working on V2 variant which will incorporate better UI, Detection Algorithms and better performance
- than its predecessor.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  My community engagement was mostly in Reddit, whatsapp and discord Unlike S/W development security discussions were more common on these platforms and i was able to
-  clear a lot of doubts to the new comers, We also made sure that our Junios in college also had a good introduction to Cybersecurity by starting community groups as
-  well as oraginizing CTF challenges.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- Most of my technical writings are on linkedin . It mainly discusses around current trends , attacks and so on
- linkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/santo-cyriac-twoside2004/

#### Highly Used Security Tools:

- For security purposes the most used tools are NMAP,metasploit,Autopsy for forensics, burpsuite, Wazuh, splunk.
