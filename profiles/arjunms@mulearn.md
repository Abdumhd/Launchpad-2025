### About Me

>  I am a Curious Guy who loves to tinker with tech and build products. Basically, I am a Python Developer but I don't want to limit myself to that one stack and I love exploring new things. I am the Author of [SQL-Ease](https://sqlease.buildnship.in), a AI powered webapp which lets you convert natural language into SQL Query. Now, my interest is more into building and shipping products
