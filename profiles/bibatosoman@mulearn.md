My experience as a class representative helped me develop strong communication and interpersonal skills, allowing me to listen, mediate, and connect with diverse groups. I plan to continue expanding my professional network by attending tech meetups, contributing to open-source projects, and staying active on platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn.

#### Career Plan:

After completing my studies, I aim to secure a position in a well-reputed IT firm where I can apply and enhance my technical and analytical skills. My long-term goal is to become a successful Data Analyst in a leading tech industry, contributing to data-driven decision-making and innovative solutions. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I aspire to build a career that combines my passion for data with impactful real-world applications.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has great potential to excel in the technology startup ecosystem by strengthening its infrastructure, promoting innovation in colleges, and supporting entrepreneurs through schemes by Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM). With initiatives like the upcoming Digital Science Park and district-level Freedom Squares, Kerala is encouraging both urban and rural innovation. By focusing on areas like AI, robotics, and sustainability, and by promoting collaboration between industry and academia, Kerala can become a leading hub for inclusive and impactful startups in the future.
