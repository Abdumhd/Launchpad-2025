### About Me

Currently a 4th year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering at the College of Engineering Thalassery, Kannur, Kerala. I'm passionate about becoming a full-stack web developer with a strong focus on backend development, UI/UX, and Python. My motivation stems from building real-world solutions that have an impact—turning creative ideas into functional applications. I'm continuously exploring new technologies and currently focused on mastering backend frameworks, building scalable apps, and sharpening my UI/UX design skills to become an industry-ready developer.

#### Leadership and Influence:

I have actively volunteered in my college's technical fests like **Innovus** and AI expos such as **Agnitus**, where I contributed to organizing and assisting workshops and demo booths. I've also taken leadership in team-based academic projects, helping teammates with Git workflows, design, and debugging. As an intern at **Eqsoft** and **Grohub**, I collaborated with teams and showcased initiative in managing tasks independently and delivering results under guidance.

#### Networking:

I connect with peers and mentors through college events, LinkedIn, and Discord communities. I’ve engaged with fellow developers during tech meetups and intend to expand this through platforms like GitHub and open-source forums. I also aim to contribute and learn through µLearn and developer groups, helping others with tech concepts and sharing resources.

#### Career Plan:

In the short term, I aim to strengthen my skills in backend frameworks (like Django, ASP.NET), cloud deployment, and contribute to open-source. My long-term goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer, mentor juniors, and collaborate with Kerala-based tech startups to build smart, scalable solutions that address real-world challenges. I also plan to build resources and content that make learning tech easier for beginners in the state.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has immense talent and potential, especially among its youth. With more mentorship programs, hands-on tech challenges, and startup-friendly support systems, Kerala can become a national leader in the tech startup space. Encouraging a maker culture and bridging academia with industry needs will be the key.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

Currently in the early stages of contributing to open-source. I’ve forked and explored various repositories, and I’m planning to start contributing to beginner-friendly projects on GitHub. I'm also working on making some of my personal tools open source.

#### History of Community Engagement:

I’m active in community-driven learning spaces like Discord servers related to web development and open-source. I’ve helped peers during college hackathons and assisted juniors in understanding Git, UI tools, and code structuring. I’m working toward more structured involvement in Stack Overflow and GitHub discussions.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

Currently focusing on building projects, but plan to launch a technical blog series soon explaining backend development for beginners and real-world project breakdowns. Video content may follow.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

I frequently use tools like **VS Code**, **Figma**, **Canva**, and AI tools for design, coding, and productivity. Some utilities I built for personal use (like automated Python scripts) are being improved for public release.
