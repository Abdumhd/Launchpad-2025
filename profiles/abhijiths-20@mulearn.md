### About Me

> I'm a second-year B.Tech Computer Science student with a keen passion for technology. A self-learner, my love for tech began during upper primary and high school. I chose Computer Science as my stream in higher secondary and have continued my journey into B.Tech.  
>
> Over time, Iâ€™ve learned various programming languages including `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Python`, `C`, and `C++`. Currently, I am diving deeper into building projects using React frameworks. I enjoy building projects during my free time and am always exploring new technologies and tools â€” including AI â€” to enhance my development workflow.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has a vibrant and growing tech community that is often underestimated. With a high literacy rate and a strong educational foundation, the state produces a large number of technically skilled graduates every year. However, there is still a gap in converting this talent into successful startups or product-based companies.

One of the most promising aspects of Keralaâ€™s ecosystem is the **community-driven initiatives** like **Mulearn**, **TinkerHub**, **IEEE chapters**, and government programs like **Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM)**, which provide budding developers and innovators with the exposure and mentorship they need.

I believe with the right push and sustained collaboration between **students, professionals, institutions, and the government**, Kerala can become one of Indiaâ€™s top startup and innovation hubs in the coming decade.
