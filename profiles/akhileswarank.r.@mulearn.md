### About Me

> I'm a third-year student at Sree Chitra Thirunal College of Engineering in Thiruvananthapuram, where I study computer science. I like to code, solve problems with DSA, and construct websites. I'm learning React and Express.js to create full-stack web apps right now. Exploring new technology and honing my abilities through practical tasks and teamwork constantly draws my interest.

#### Networking:

- By taking part in student communities, academic groups, and tech events, I actively cultivate relationships with my peers. I like working with others, exchanging ideas, and assisting others in taking advantage of new chances. I inspire others to take charge, learn, and advance in the industry by being personable, supportive, and reliable.

#### Career Plan:

- By working on practical projects and taking in information from my surroundings, I intend to concentrate on improving my technical and communication abilities in the near future. In addition to attending events and interacting with like-minded individuals, I want to learn how early-stage ideas develop.

- Through fostering a culture of learning, creativity, and entrepreneurship among students, supporting local inventions, and working together on significant projects, I intend to use these experiences to make a significant long-term contribution to the Kerala Startup Ecosystem.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- I think that by promoting student creativity, enhancing skill development, and expanding access to resources, Kerala can establish a robust environment for tech startups. More young ideas can have a significant influence if they receive more support, exposure, and mentoring.
