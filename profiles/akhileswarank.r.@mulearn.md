#### Networking:

- I actively build connections with peers by participating in tech events, academic groups, and student communities. I enjoy collaborating, sharing knowledge, and helping others get involved in new opportunities. I lead by being approachable, encouraging, and consistentâ€”motivating others to step up, learn, and grow within the field.

#### Career Plan:

- In the immediate term, I plan to focus on developing my technical and communication skills by working on real-world projects and learning from the environment around me. I aim to engage with like-minded peers, attend events, and understand how early-stage ideas grow.

- In the long term, I hope to use these experiences to contribute meaningfully to the Kerala Startup Ecosystem by supporting local innovations, collaborating on impactful projects, and encouraging a culture of learning, creativity, and entrepreneurship among students.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- I believe Kerala can grow a strong tech startup ecosystem by encouraging student innovation, improving skill development, and making resources more accessible. With better mentorship, exposure, and support, more young ideas can turn into real impact.
