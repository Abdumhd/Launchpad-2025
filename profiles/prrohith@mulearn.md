## 👋 About Me  
Hi, I’m **P R Rohith**, a B.Tech student in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** at **ACE College of Engineering, Trivandrum**.  
I’m passionate about AI and how it’s reshaping the world. I enjoy blending tech with real life — whether it’s vibe coding or exploring how AI can be part of everyday experiences.  
I’m a fast learner, always curious, and constantly looking for ways to level up my skills — especially in **AI**, **app development**, and building things that matter.
