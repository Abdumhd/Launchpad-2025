### About Me
>I'm a BTech CS and Design 3rd year student at GEC Kozhikode with a strong foundation in Cybersecurity and Web development.I'm currently enrolled in a cybersecurity bootcamp under µLearn in collaboration with OWASP Kerala. I actively train on platforms like TryHackMe and have participated in events like CTF Industrial Intrusion, developing skills in penetration testing, network security, and ethical hacking.I'm also experienced in frontend development using `React`, `JavaScript`, HTML, and CSS, and have worked with backendtechnologies like `Node.js` and `MongoDB`, with beginner-level experience in `Express.js`. I regularly use Kali Linux and tools such as Nmap and Burp Suite to explore both offensive and defensive aspects of security.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- Led a Team of 4 Members to Industrial Intrusion CTF hosted by TryHackME
- I also led a team in a statewide fashion-tech competition (Inara) conducted by IEEE, where we combined GenAI with design. My team secured 3rd place and won a cash prize of ₹40,000. I was responsible for ideation, technical execution, and coordination with teammates, which taught me how to guide a team under pressure and deliver creative solutions within a deadline. 

#### Networking:

-Participated in Hackathon like PyHack and meetups like IEEE YESS 2024 and Infinia which help me connect with many people.

#### Career Plan:

- In the Immediate term , I plan to pen test systems find vulnerabilities, create web apps etc
- In the Long term , I see myself in a Cybersecurity Firm or Community protecting Users against modern AI threats.  

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala have one of the best Tech atmosphere , but along with that news like Data leakages , Suicides due to Chinese Loan Apps etc are increasing.
- We have so many Tech graduates but the Job availability is kind of dull , more people need to start think of staying here and build rather than escaping to foreign countries.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

-While I’m at the beginning of my open-source journey, I’ve already started contributing by sharing my own projects publicly and actively learning how collaborative development works.


#### Competitive Website Profiles:

- Active Member on TryHackMe as SEEKER currently
