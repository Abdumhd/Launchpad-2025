| **ARTHAMUDHRA**  |       Arthamudhra is a Malayalam Sign Language Translator developed using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The project aims to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community and the general public. It recognizes Malayalam hand signs in real-time using a trained model and converts them into readable text through a user-friendly web interface built with Flask. Arthamudhra showcases the application of AI in accessibility and promotes inclusivity through technology. |  -- | [Repo Link](https://github.com/A-bhi-jit-h/ARTHAMUDHRA)             |

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I’ve actively taken on leadership roles in both technical and organizational settings. As a coordinator for “Code Python”, a bootcamp conducted by CSI SCT SB, I helped plan and deliver hands-on Python sessions, guiding participants throughout the event. I also led the development of Arthamudhra, a Malayalam Sign Language Translator, where I managed a small team to build and deploy a real-time AI-based application. These experiences strengthened my skills in mentoring, teamwork, and project execution.

#### Networking:

- As an active member of μLearn, I’ve had the opportunity to connect with a wide network of tech enthusiasts, mentors, and peers across Kerala. Being part of the μComics team, I collaborated with others to conceptualize and create a μComics Interest Group, aimed at blending creativity with technology to engage the community. This role involved reaching out to like-minded individuals, initiating discussions, and organizing collaborative efforts to build momentum around the group. 

#### Career Plan:

- Immediate plan: Intern or work with a Kerala-based startup or innovation hub to gain hands-on experience in real-world AI applications and contribute technically to meaningful products.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has enormous potential due to its strong literacy rate, youth tech talent.However, to excel, we need more collaboration between academia and startups, open innovation models, and localized product development. Focused support for AI, cybersecurity, and climate tech can position Kerala as a national leader in sustainable and inclusive innovation.
