#### Leadership and Influence:

- I’ve taken the lead in technical collaborations during bootcamps and college-level projects, where I guided peers, handled planning, and resolved key implementation issues. I’m known for helping others troubleshoot and stay motivated to complete technical tasks.

#### Networking:

- I'm actively involved in communities like MuLearn and IEEE SB CEK, where I consistently engage in discussions, share resources, and support others. I plan to grow my network further by mentoring juniors and collaborating on real-world projects. As I'm a part of several communities in our college, I've actively connected with my fellow students.
Moreover, I love to expand my network with like-minded fellows and I think this will be a perfect chance for me.

#### Career Plan:

- My immediate goal is to upskill through hands-on contributions and collaborative projects. Long-term, I aim to support Kerala's developer ecosystem by building tools, mentoring talent, and promoting a culture of practical innovation, getting a good job.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has strong potential due to its talent pool, but we need more focus on product development, mentorship, and startup incubation beyond major cities. With the right support, we can become a leading hub for innovation.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I haven't made any contribution to the open-source community, but have worked for several works of my college event website, for hackathons etc. And I'm planning to upskill my current skillset and start contributing to the community. Also me with my friends are planning for a project to build.

#### History of Community Engagement:

- As a core member of IEEE, MuLearn KNP, and the Gaming Club, I’ve actively participated in organizing events, solving peer queries, and maintaining community engagement in both tech and creative spaces.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- I’ve published cybersecurity writeups and bootcamp task guides that are used by peers for learning and reference during MuLearn and OWASP activities.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- I’ve shared small automation tools and scripts used by fellow students in clubs and communities to ease repetitive tasks and improve productivity. I mostly use vscode and colab.
As part of a hackathon with the help of my friends, I've made some productive tools like to-do app, ai chatbot, yt video summarizer etc.
