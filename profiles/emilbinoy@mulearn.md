#### Leadership and Influence:

- SAP Hackathon (Team Contributor): As a core team member, we reached the third round of a competitive SAP hackathon. I facilitated brainstorming, defined strategies, and ensured cohesive teamwork. During rapid prototyping, I coordinated tasks and guided module integration, directly impacting our progress. My communication and motivation skills were crucial to our team's strong performance.

#### Networking:

- Collaborated with teammates to participate in a multi-round hackathon conducted by SAP; our strong teamwork and coordination helped us advance to the 3rd round out of 4.
- I serve as the Innovation Lead at [Inovus Labs](https://inovuslabs.org/home), the IEDC (Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre) team in my college.
#### Career Plan:

- In the short term, I aim to contribute by building impactful web solutions and actively engaging in startup communities. Long term, I plan to mentor budding developers and launch my own startup that solves real-world problems from Kerala.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has a strong foundation with its skilled youth and support from initiatives like KSUM. To excel further, we need to strengthen industry-academia collaboration, promote digital product building, and foster a startup culture focused on innovation and global impact.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I have contributed to open-source by collaborating on community projects, focusing on improving code quality and supporting developer-friendly tools. Through fixing issues and engaging with contributors, I continue to grow as a developer while supporting the open-source ecosystem — including participating in initiatives like Hacktoberfest.
#### History of Community Engagement:

- As a member of [Inovus Labs](https://inovuslabs.org/home), a student community under IEDC in our college, I contributed to organizing a program called CCA, where I taught the basics of web development to 8th standard students. I also regularly support my peers by reviewing and correcting my friends code, helping them improve their projects and debugging skills.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- While I haven't published any technical articles or videos yet, I’m planning to create content based on my experiences in web development to contribute to the developer community.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- I haven’t developed any widely used software tools yet, but I’m working on improving my skills and hope to build tools that can help developers and users in the future.
