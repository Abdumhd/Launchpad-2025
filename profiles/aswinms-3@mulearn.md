### About Me

> I’m a Computer Science undergrad at SJCET Palai, passionate about building real-world software using Python, backend systems, and web technologies. I enjoy developing AI tools, command-line apps, and exploring open-source. I’ve worked on tools like DevTracker CLI and voice translation apps. I'm also deeply interested in cybersecurity and developer tooling, and I actively participate in tech competitions and community challenges.

| **Voice Language Translator** | Speech-to-speech translator built with Python (`speech_recognition`, `deep_translator`, `gTTS`). Supports 70+ languages and real-time playback. | — | [Repo Link](https://github.com/aswinms926/Language_translator) |

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I frequently support peers with GitHub, coding challenges, and project ideation. I help juniors understand tools like version control, project structure, and backend integration. I’ve also led brainstorming sessions for inclusive tech projects and team challenges.

#### Networking:

- I actively engage in Discord communities like µLearn and Codedex. I’ve collaborated on open-source events, taken part in group challenges, and regularly reach out to developers to exchange ideas and get feedback on tools.

#### Career Plan:

- My short-term goal is to work as a backend or full-stack developer in a startup. Long-term, I aim to build developer productivity tools, contribute to ethical AI, and establish open communities for tech learners in Kerala and beyond.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has vibrant tech learners but needs stronger collaboration between colleges, startups, and open-source. With more project-based mentorship, AI innovation hubs, and public technical content, Kerala can be a leader in developer education and ethical startups.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I’ve published multiple Python-based tools on GitHub such as DevTracker CLI and Voice Language Translator with proper usage guides and modular structure. I’m preparing to actively contribute to external issues on tools like Flask and argparse-based utilities.

#### History of Community Engagement:

- Participated in µLearn challenges, Codedex monthly projects, and Discord brainstorming sessions. Built a game prototype idea for children with cognitive disabilities. I also encourage juniors to submit PRs and create portfolios.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- Created illustrated lightning talk decks like *The Bamboo and the Fern – A Tale of Growth* which gained positive community response. I plan to share more technical write-ups and projects publicly.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- **DevTracker CLI** is publicly available for developers to analyze Git commit history and view contribution stats. Designed for ease of use and extensibility. I plan to publish more terminal-based developer tools soon.

#### Competitive Website Profiles:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/aswinms926) – Open-source project contributor and personal tool developer.  
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/aswin-ms-cse) – Showcasing projects, achievements, and professional journey.
