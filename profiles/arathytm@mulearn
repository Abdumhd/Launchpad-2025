# Arathy T.M.

### About Me

I am a final-year **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** student at the **College of Engineering, Munnar**, with a strong enthusiasm for full-stack development, hands-on tech building, and learning through practical problem-solving.

My journey in tech has grown from working on a hardware project called **Musical Stairs**, to building creative web projects like a **Women Safety App** and a fun experiment called the **Future Time Machine**. I enjoy exploring the MERN stack, frontend development with HTML/CSS/JS, and am currently improving my backend knowledge with Node.js and MongoDB.

Serving as the **TinkerHub Campus Lead from June 2024 to June 2025**, I helped drive peer learning and community-based tech growth on campus, mentoring juniors and organizing collaborative initiatives.

I’m eager to learn, experiment, and contribute to meaningful projects—whether in electronics, web development, or tech-for-social-good ideas that have real-world impact.
