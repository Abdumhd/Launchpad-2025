### About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at AWH Engineering College and currently working as an SDE 1 at [Dichit](https://dichit.money/). My core focus is backend development, and I work primarily with Spring Boot and TypeScript in building scalable, reliable systems.
<br>
I enjoy designing robust APIs, writing clean backend logic, and ensuring system performance and maintainability. My experience includes working with distributed services and contributing to production-level code in real-world environments.
<br>
I'm always eager to learn, improve my problem-solving skills, and explore better ways to build efficient backend systems.

#### Leadership and Influence:
I'm the campus lead of µLearn at AWH Engineering College, where I guide juniors through learning tasks and help them level up their skills. As the community lead in IEDC AWH, I coordinate events and have conducted workshops to promote tech learning. I occasionally share informative content on LinkedIn and actively support juniors by clearing their programming doubts and encouraging consistent growth.

#### Networking:
As the campus lead of µLearn and community lead at IEDC AWH, I’ve built strong networking skills by organizing events, conducting workshops, and mentoring peers. I plan to engage more by collaborating across campuses and hosting tech sessions. I aim to lead by sharing knowledge, guiding juniors, and creating a supportive developer community.

#### Career Plan:
In the short term, I’m working at Dichit, a Kerala-based startup backed by KSUM, where I plan to grow into a Senior SDE role. I enjoy contributing there and learning from the startup environment. In the long term, I aspire to found my own startup and contribute to Kerala’s startup ecosystem by fostering innovation and entrepreneurship.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:
Kerala has immense potential to excel in the technology startup ecosystem due to its growing pool of talented developers and the rising interest in innovation. With the booming startup culture, especially driven by emerging fields like AI, Kerala can become a major hub by fostering collaboration, supporting early-stage startups, and encouraging continuous learning.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:
I’ve developed and maintained several open-source projects, including Study Hive, Creditflow, and Scribble, which are available on GitHub. These projects focus on practical applications like learning platforms, finance management, and blogging tools. Through these, I contribute to the community by sharing code, encouraging collaboration, and helping others learn by example.

#### History of Community Engagement:
I actively engage with the tech community by mentoring juniors at my college, helping them solve programming doubts and encouraging skill development. As the campus lead of µLearn and community lead at IEDC AWH, I organize workshops and events to promote learning and collaboration. While I’m not very active on platforms like Stack Overflow, I focus on direct community support through college forums, Discord groups, and LinkedIn.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:
I’ve created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SabarishAV/PostgreSQL-Installation-in-Arch-Linux) that offers a clear, step-by-step guide for installing and setting up PostgreSQL on Arch Linux. This resource helps developers quickly configure PostgreSQL on a less common platform, filling a useful niche in the community

#### Competitive Website Profiles:
I’m active on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/avsabarish), where I solve coding challenges to sharpen my problem-solving and algorithm skills.
