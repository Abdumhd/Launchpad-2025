### About Me

> I'm a final-year B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and solving real-world problems using technology. With hands-on experience in computer vision, speech processing, and embedded systems, I’ve worked on various projects ranging from zebrafish trajectory tracking to AI-based grammar scoring engines. I also have a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, Python development, and enjoy contributing to interdisciplinary research. I aspire to work in the AI/ML domain and grow into a technically influential role in the future.

### My Projects

| Name                | Description                                                               | Repo Link                                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Zebrafish Trajectory Analysis**  | 3D trajectory extraction and visualization from dual-lens camera footage to analyze zebrafish behavior. | [Repo Link](https://github.com/MalooD-Lu/Zebrafish-Tracking-and-Path-Prediction)             |
| **SHL Grammar Scoring**  | Built a deep learning pipeline using Wav2Vec2 and Whisper encoder features to predict grammar scores from audio. | [Repo Link](https://github.com/MalooD-Lu/OpenAI-s-Whisper-for-grammar-score) |

#### Leadership and Influence:

-I have demonstrated leadership both academically and creatively. As the Head of Design for my college’s ECE Society, I led a team that handled all visual communications and branding for events and workshops. I coordinated with core committee members to ensure every poster, presentation, and digital asset aligned with our goals and looked professional. This experience helped me build confidence, manage time under deadlines, and lead a team effectively.

In technical settings, I’ve also taken ownership of key parts of projects, such as integrating dual-camera 3D tracking in my zebrafish research and leading model design in AI competitions. I consistently aim to take initiative, offer solutions, and help my team stay aligned with deadlines and goals.

#### Networking:

-I actively engage with tech communities on platforms like Discord, GitHub, and Kaggle. I participate in coding challenges, hackathons, and discussions, and plan to take a more active role by organizing Python/AI workshops locall

#### Career Plan:

- In the short term, I want to work as an AI/ML Developer and gain experience with scalable model deployments and productization. In the long term, I aim to launch or join an AI-based startup focusing on healthtech or education.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has immense talent but lacks visibility and startup acceleration compared to other Indian states. By promoting tech literacy, investing in college startups, and improving collaboration between academia and industry, Kerala can become a thriving deep-tech hub. Better mentorship programs and seed funding access would make a significant difference.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Share details of your open-source contributions, whether they are your own projects or contributions to highly popular projects in the open-source community.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- If you've developed software tools that are widely used by users (not just contributors), mention them.

#### Competitive Website Profiles:
