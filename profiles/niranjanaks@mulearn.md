#### Leadership and Influence:

- Acted as Campus Ambassador for the Kerala Knowledge Economy Mission, connecting students to ecosystem initiatives. I’ve also led project teams during internships and college work, contributing significantly to design and backend decisions.

#### Networking:

- I actively connect with tech communities on platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn. I plan to mentor juniors, contribute to beginner-friendly open-source issues, and stay involved in technical meetups and online communities.

#### Career Plan:

- In the short term, I aim to join a tech-driven company or startup in Kerala where I can apply and expand my skills in web development and machine learning. Long-term, I hope to mentor aspiring developers and contribute to Kerala’s digital transformation through community tech initiatives.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

-Kerala has many talented young people who are good with technology, but their skills are not fully used yet. To grow the startup scene here, we should support students in building real-world projects and help them connect with companies. Giving more chances to women in tech and encouraging open-source work will also make the tech community stronger and more active.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I’ve contributed to open-source through projects like Budget-Buddy and Life-Lens, and plan to participate more actively in Hacktoberfest and beginner-friendly GitHub projects that support accessibility and inclusion.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- I created a portfolio website ([Portfolio Link](https://niranjana-03.github.io/Portfolio/)) to showcase my work and plan to start writing technical blogs on real-world project building with Django and Flask.
