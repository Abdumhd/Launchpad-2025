#### Leadership and Influence:

I am presently the Skill Officer of Events within the IEDC Executive Committee, where I contribute to  responsible for defining, driving, and executing the long-term vision and strategic direction of the organization. I work closely with the CSO and other C-suite leaders to align goals, identify growth opportunities, etc. By coordinating events, guiding teams, and fostering a culture of collaboration, I have inspired individuals in the technology. My approach to leadership emphasizes teamwork, innovative problem-solving, and a commitment to ongoing learning.

#### Networking:

As a first-year student in Electronics and Communication Engineering and a member of the IEDC Executive Committee, I am eager to connect with fellow students, experienced professionals, and mentors through technology events and collaborative endeavors.

#### Career Plan:

As a second-year student, my immediate plan is to actively participate in IEDC activities, learn from startup events, and collaborate on innovative student projects that address real-world problems. I would start my own start-up based on a new technological issue.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala’s tech ecosystem is one of India’s most strategic, sustainable, and people-focused. It is more Talent-Driven and Not Hype-Driven. The state produces quality talent, many of whom migrate—but now, more are returning or working remotely from Kerala due to better infrastructure and lifestyle.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

I haven’t had the opportunity to contribute to open-source projects yet, but I’m eager to start exploring this space.
#### History of Community Engagement:

I’m just starting to engage with technical communities, and I’ve been exploring platforms like Discord to learn and share knowledge. I have participated in discussions as a team or group.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

I have not created any technical blog posts, articles,etc

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

I haven’t developed widely used software tools yet
