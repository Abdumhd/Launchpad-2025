#### Leadership and Influence:

I am presently the Skill Officer of Events within the IEDC Executive Committee, where I contribute to  responsible for defining, driving, and executing the long-term vision and strategic direction of the organization. I work closely with the CSO and other C-suite leaders to align goals, identify growth opportunities,etc. By coordinating events, guiding teams, and fostering a culture of collaboration, I have inspired individuals in the technology. My approach to leadership emphasizes teamwork, innovative problem-solving, and a commitment to ongoing learning.

s a first-year student, my immediate plan is to actively participate in IEDC activities, learn from startup events, and collaborate on innovative student projects that address real-world problems. I would start my own start-up based on a new technological issue.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala’s tech ecosystem is one of India’s most strategic, sustainable, and people-focused. It is more Talent-Driven and Not Hype-Driven. The state produces quality talent, many of whom migrate—but now, more are returning or working remotely from Kerala due to better infrastructure and lifestyle.
