#### Leadership and Influence:

- I am currently spearheading the initiative to establish an official µLearn Campus Chapter at my college. This leadership role involves coordinating with µLearn mentors, presenting the value proposition to college faculty, and mobilizing fellow students to build a foundational team. My aim is to influence my peers by creating a structured platform for collaborative learning, skill development, and connecting with the broader tech ecosystem. By pioneering this effort, I am actively working to foster a stronger technical culture on campus and empower students to pursue their interests in technology.

#### Networking:

- My networking approach is centered on active participation in vibrant online technical communities. I am a regular member of several Discord servers, such as WeCode and the QSL Community, where I engage in discussions, ask questions, and help others when I can. This allows me to build connections with peers and learn from experienced mentors in the field. Looking forward, I plan to leverage this experience by taking on a more influential role. My initiative to start a µLearn Campus Chapter is a core part of this plan, as it will create a formal network for students at my college. I also intend to begin attending local tech meetups and workshops to build in-person connections and further integrate myself into the Kerala tech community, aiming to both learn from and contribute to its growth.

#### Career Plan:

- **Immediate Plan (1-2 Years):** My primary goal upon graduating is to secure a software developer position within a growing Kerala-based startup. I am eager to immerse myself in the professional tech environment and apply my skills in AI, Mobile, or Web Development to real-world challenges. This initial phase of my career will be focused on honing my technical abilities, learning industry best practices, and understanding what makes a tech business succeed from the inside.
- **Long-Term Plan (5+ Years):** My long-term aspiration is to become a tech entrepreneur and contribute directly to the innovation landscape in Kerala. Using the experience and insights gained from my initial career, I plan to launch my own startup. My vision is to build a company that not only solves meaningful problems with technology but also creates valuable employment opportunities, mentors the next generation of developers, and plays an active role in strengthening Kerala's position as a leading technology hub.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala possesses a unique and powerful advantage with its high literacy rate and a fundamentally strong talent pool. The proactive support from government initiatives like the Kerala Startup Mission has created a vibrant and encouraging atmosphere for new ideas to sprout. To elevate itself to a top-tier global ecosystem, I believe the next step is to focus on bridging the gap between academic knowledge and industry demands. By integrating more hands-on, practical workshops and mandatory internships with local startups into our college curriculum, students can graduate with the exact skills the industry needs. Furthermore, fostering a more robust early-stage investment culture is key. Encouraging local angel investors and making seed funding more accessible for student-led projects would empower more young entrepreneurs to take calculated risks. By combining our inherent talent with practical industry exposure and accessible capital, I am confident Kerala can become a world-renowned hub for sustainable and innovative technology startups.
