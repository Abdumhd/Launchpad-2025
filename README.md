### About Me

I'm a Computer Science graduate (2024) with a specialization in Intelligent Systems. I'm genuinely passionate about technology. Over the past few years, I've built a solid technical foundation through hands-on projects, coursework, and self-learning.

For the last 8 months, I’ve been working on an idea that tries to solve real-world logistics challenges using Route Optimization combined with Bin Packing. The aim was to build a product that could improve delivery efficiency by finding the best travel routes while optimizing space usage. Although the project is still in progress and not fully completed, it’s been a great learning journey that pushed me to explore complex algorithms and practical system design.

Alongside my technical skills, I value clear communication, teamwork, and creative problem-solving. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and take pride in learning things on my own when needed. Whether it’s building intelligent systems, designing full-stack applications, or exploring new ideas, I’m always excited to take on meaningful challenges and grow along the way..

| **Drug Repurposing**  |  This project uses Python with NumPy, TensorFlow, Pandas, and Keras to develop a novel graph neural network for drug repositioning. The model optimizes drug–disease association modeling and validation, showcasing Python's power in advanced machine learning for biomedical applications.        |  [Drug Repurposing](https://github.com/athifal/Drug-repurposing-using-GNN)             |
| **CircRNA-Disease association prediction based on Autoencoder And XGBoost Classifier**  |This project is a computer-based method that combines XGBoost and autoencoders to analyze the relationships between Circular RNAs (circRNA) and chronic human diseases. By leveraging circRNA sequences, disease semantics, and disease interactions, XGB-AE generates valuable features for classification. Our model achieved high performance                                          |  [Circ-RNA-Disease association](https://github.com/athifal/CirRNA-interaction-XGboost-autoencoder)  |
