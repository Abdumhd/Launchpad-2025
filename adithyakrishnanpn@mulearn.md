## About Me
I am a passionate final-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at Marian Engineering College, Trivandrum. My technical journey has been focused on deep learning, computer vision, and full-stack development, with hands-on experience building AI-powered solutions.

My projects like the Driver Drowsiness Detection System and Emotion Recognition CNN demonstrate my ability to implement computer vision solutions using OpenCV and deep learning frameworks. I'm particularly fascinated by transformer architectures, as shown in my ongoing GPT-from-scratch implementation following Andrej Karpathy's work.

Beyond technical skills, I bring strong problem-solving abilities and a commitment to continuous learning. My recent work on MicroMentor AI showcases my ability to bridge AI with practical applications in career development. I approach each project with both technical rigor and user-centric design thinking.
